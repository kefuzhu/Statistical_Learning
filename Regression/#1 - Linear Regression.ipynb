    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence of observations**: There is no relationship between each observation/data point. One opposite example is time-series data\n",
    "2. **Linear relationship**: the change in the response due to a one-unit change in a predictor is constant, regardless of the value of that predictor\n",
    "3. **Normality of residuals**: residuals should follow normal distribution, which can be assessed by histogram or Q-Q plot\n",
    "4. **No or little multicollinearity**: predictors should not be highly correlated with each other, which can be assessed by VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)\n",
    "5. **Homoscedasticity or constant variance**: the error is constant along the values of the predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Least Square\n",

    "The least quares appeoach chooses $\\hat{\\beta}$ to minimize the **RSS (Residual Sum of Squares)**\n",

    "\n",
    "Sample mean $\\hat{\\mu}$ is an unbiased estimator to population mean $\\mu$, in the sense that on average, we expect $\\hat{\\mu}$ to equal $\\mu$. However, a single estimate $\\hat{\\mu}$ may be a substantial undersestimate or overestimate of $\\mu$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Standard error of $\\hat{\\mu}$, written as $SE(\\hat{\\mu})$, meansures how har off will that single estimate of $\\hat{\\mu}$ be\n",

    "For linear regression, the 95% confidence interval for $\\beta_i$ approximately takes the form\n",

For instance, when $p = 100$ and $H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = ... = \\beta_p = 0$ is true, no variable is truly associated with the response. However, still about $5\\%$ of the p-values associated with each variable can be below $0.05$ by chance.\n",

    "**Limitation**: The approach of using F-statistic to test for any association between the predictors and response works when $p$ is relatively small, and certainly smaller compared to $n$. If $p > n$ then there are more coefficients $\\beta_j$ to estimate than observations from which to estimate them.\n",

    "In this case, we cannot fit the multiple linear regression with least squares, so the F-statistic cannot be used.\n",
